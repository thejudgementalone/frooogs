If there was indeed a power above, then so many would receive the retribution they deserve in full, yet one does not. But we must ask ourselves, if there was no God above, then what horrid creature held the power to answer one’s prayers?” - Some Guy

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 20px">A Farmer used to live on a large plot of land. He would sit by the brook, fishing, in his spare time. One day he accidentally hooked a frog, and when he tried to unhook it, the poor creature died. He remembered what his father told him when fishing, “I’d rather you go for the little fish, but I know you’ll go for things deeper under the surface. That’s fine, if you can reel ‘em in, but never, and I mean never, reel up a frog. They’re beautiful creatures, placed on this Earth for joy and empathy. While the fish kill relentlessly, a frog wants nothing more than to chirp its song and hop on a lilypad down by the lake.”

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 20px">Later that evening, resting in bed, the Farmer cried one single, watery tear for the wondrous creature he had destroyed. He had sinned to all that was Holy, all that existed in the Heavens above, he prayed that he could repent for such a horrible, cardinal sin. But he dreamt of a dear frog, and it looked towards forgivingly. He awoke joyful, for he was indeed happy, feeling atoned for what he had done.

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 20px">The next day, he was fishing down by the river again, when a fly flew upon his neck and bit him. But then, a frog hopped to his side. It was soft, plump, and green, like a divine balloon. But it spoke to him. “The fly bit you, did it not? Seek retribution against this creature, smite it with your blessed palm.” The Farmer thought for just a moment before his hand came down, crushing the disgusting creature, turning into a ruptured sac of what it once was. When he looked down, the pure creature had disappeared.

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 20px">Years passed, and he never thought about that moment, thinking it a mere hallucination from the heat of Summer’s peak. But then, a hog had escaped its pen, and when he found it, the frog appeared once more. “The hog disobeyed, did it not? Seek retribution against this creature, beat it like it deserves so that it will never leave again.” The Farmer thought hard, before his hand came down, hitting the pitiful creature, and after it was beaten unconscious, he dragged it back to the pen, where it deserved to lay.

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 20px">Years passed, and he rarely thought about that moment, thinking it a strange repeat of the fly. Crops began to decay, a horrid blight swept over the pastures, and their very lives were risky. He had discovered, from his wife’s teary explanation, that she had given away a measure of crops, without price, to a family who could no longer afford any. They could not afford to take such action in this scenario. The frog, ever graceful and devoid of any physical malignancies, appeared once on his shoulder, his wife unfazed as if she didn’t see it.

	<div style="background-color: #40B417; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; height: 70px; padding-bottom: 30px">“Your wife betrayed, did she not? Seek retribution against this creature, cause pain so that a lesson is learned. You’ve gotten so far. Merely take down one more life, bring it low to the mud, so that you may stand upon it, as a greater being.” The Farmer locked eyes with his wife for a long few minutes, before he replied to the creature, “No. She’s my wife, I would never do something like this. Those innocent lives were in need, and she went out of her way to help them…” But the Frog would not take this so lightly. A celestial, blazing orange light consumed the room, as crab-like legs emerged from the mouth of the frog, hooking into the room as it dissolved into the very cosmos.

You could walk the road of Retribution, or Mercy. You started on a path of Retribution yet you could not follow through. I gave you a chance, a single chance, more than most get in a thousand years. You could prove that you are greater than the rest, yet you abandoned this. You prayed for a greater life form to forgive you, and you were blessed. But you threw away this chance at ascension. I could’ve thrown you aside to the Ethereal Pits of Cosmic Horrors unexplainable to a mind, virgin in the ways of true existence, yet I let you atone for killing a fellow of my kind. I will let you savor this moment, this vibrant moment, for it is the last second that your life bears meaning. Your crops are dying, I wished this Plague upon you to hasten one’s decision. You bore every right to strike retribution, she was as good as a thief. Yet you showed mercy, while seeking Retribution against the Formers. So savor this, savor this one last sight of a creature infinitely greater than you, and pray, pray that when Judgment comes, it shall be swift, and without malevolency.
